Errors:
- take union of flags when doing matching (no, the current version is correct)
- consider types when matching and unifying

Enhancements:
- handle general icmp matching
- collect more stats about loops, eg what opts are involved

- handle nsw:0 et al
- isConstant()

- Prof: header?

Possible:
- simplify EquivalenceClass into DisjointSubsets
- break compose() into smaller pieces
- rework Type to make finding subtype and lub easier
